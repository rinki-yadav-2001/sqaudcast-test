Project: Mentions component

# Mention App

This is a simple React application that implements the @-mentions functionality.

This is similar to the @-mentions in X/Twitter. The user can type any text in
the input element but when user types @ then a select box should appear from which
they can select an option and it should be displayed in input element. For example Hi
@Luke Skywalker may the force be with you.. An onChange handler should be triggered
with the input and the options selected, in a format of your choice.
